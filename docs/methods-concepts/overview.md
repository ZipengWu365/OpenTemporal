This catalog emphasises when to reach for classical vs modern techniques. Each page outlines practical cues rather than implementation secrets.

## How to use this catalog

1. Start with a structural hypothesis: deterministic trend, seasonal drivers, latent states, or arbitrary dynamics.
2. Shortlist method families whose inductive biases match that structure.
3. Reconcile requirements: data volume, labeling, interpretability, compute budget, and lifecycle operations.

Continue to specific method notes below or jump ahead to the [Applications](/docs/applications/overview.md) section to see how these abstractions transfer to real systems.
