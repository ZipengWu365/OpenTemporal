Applications anchor the abstract method catalog in concrete decision settings. Each domain page highlights data realities, governance needs, and method families that tend to perform well without exposing proprietary workflows.

## How to navigate

- Identify your domain below and note recurring data challenges.
- Map those challenges back to the [Knowledge Base](/docs/knowledge-base/overview.md) and [Methods & Concepts](/docs/methods-concepts/overview.md) sections.
- Reuse the pitfalls checklists before production deployments.

Domain pages cover health and aging, industrial/manufacturing, finance/risk, and IoT/sensor networks.
