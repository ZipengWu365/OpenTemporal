OpenTemporal's Knowledge Base captures shared vocabulary, conceptual frames, and navigational cues for time-series work. Use it to gain orientation before diving into specialised methods or application notes.

## Purpose

- Establish neutral terminology for representations, tasks, and evaluation.
- Surface tensions and trade-offs that appear across scientific domains.
- Connect readers onward to deeper context in the Methods & Concepts and Applications sections.

## How to read this section

1. Start with the [Landscape of Time-Series Intelligence](./landscape.md) to understand the breadth of signals and inference goals.
2. Review the [Core Tasks](./core-tasks.md) to align around shared task definitions and evaluation mindsets.
3. Explore the [Representation-First View](./representation-first.md) to appreciate why embeddings and structure-aware transforms precede model selection.

Each page intentionally links to public, well-documented resources only. If you need implementation guidance, jump to the [Tools & Starter Kits](/docs/tools-starter-kits/overview.md) collection.
