description: Structured routes for different backgrounds entering time-series work.

The learning paths highlight curated sequences of topics rather than exhaustive syllabi. Each path references other OpenTemporal sections and reputable public resources.

Paths available now:

- [Beginners to Time-Series](./beginners.md)
- [Researchers from Other Fields](./cross-disciplinary.md)
- [Engineers Building Robust Pipelines](./engineering-pipelines.md)

Feel free to remix these sequences while keeping the emphasis on transparent, reproducible workflows.
