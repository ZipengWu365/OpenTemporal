description: Translating domain expertise into time-series literacy.
---

## Prerequisites

- Deep knowledge of your source domain (biology, medicine, engineering, social science).
- Comfort reading statistical literature and interpreting experimental design.

## Core topics

1. Map domain measurements to the [Landscape of Time-Series Intelligence](../knowledge-base/landscape.md).
2. Align on [Representation-First principles](../knowledge-base/representation-first.md) to bridge domain priors with sequence embeddings.
3. Survey the [Methods & Concepts catalog](/docs/methods-concepts/overview.md), focusing on interpretability and data requirements.
4. Study governance: consent, data residency, reporting obligations.
5. Partner with engineers early to define validation datasets and monitoring plans.

## Further reading

- Survey papers listed in the [Reading Room](/docs/reading-room/overview.md).
- Initiative reports from public consortia (WHO, IEEE, FDA) on data standards.
- Workshop proceedings from NeurIPS/ICML/AAAI on time-series for science.
