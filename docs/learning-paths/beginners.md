## Prerequisites

- Comfortable with basic statistics (mean, variance, correlation).
- Introductory programming ability in Python, R, or Julia.

## Core topics

1. Read the [Knowledge Base overview](/docs/knowledge-base/overview.md) to grasp terminology.
2. Study the [Landscape](../knowledge-base/landscape.md) and [Core Tasks](../knowledge-base/core-tasks.md) pages to understand problem framing.
3. Experiment with decomposition (moving averages, STL) on public datasets.
4. Compare classical baselines (ARIMA, ETS) with simple machine learning ensembles.
5. Learn evaluation metrics: MAE, RMSE, CRPS, precision/recall for anomalies.

## Further reading

- Open-source courses such as the M4/M5 competition writeups.
- Library docs for `sktime`, `statsmodels`, and `darts`.
- The [Tools & Starter Kits overview](/docs/tools-starter-kits/overview.md) for code scaffolds.
