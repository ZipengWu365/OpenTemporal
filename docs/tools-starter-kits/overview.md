This section focuses on public, open-source tooling and reference pipelines that help operationalise the ideas described elsewhere.

Pages include:

- [Libraries and Tooling Overview](./libraries-tooling.md)
- [Starter Pipelines for Common Tasks](./starter-pipelines.md)
- [Visualization and Diagnostics](./visualization-diagnostics.md)

Pair these materials with the deployment notes in the project README before publishing any system.
