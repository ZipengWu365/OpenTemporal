title: Collaboration
description: Invitation for academic and applied partnerships around time-series intelligence.
---

OpenTemporal welcomes academically minded collaborations, interdisciplinary research discussions, and selective applied projects where rigorous time-series thinking adds value. All work discussed through this channel should rely on publicly documentable knowledge; unpublished or confidential research stays outside of this site.

## Focus areas

- Wearable and biological signals, especially aging and longitudinal modeling support.
- Industrial sensing, telemetry quality programs, and evaluation frameworks.
- Methodology guidance around representation learning, interpretability, and benchmarking.
- Evaluation audits for forecasting, anomaly detection, retrieval, and control workflows.

## How to engage

1. Share a concise project brief outlining goals, data access constraints, and timelines.
2. State collaboration expectations (research partnership, advisory cadence, or scoped build).
3. Highlight any compliance or governance requirements so we can determine feasibility early.

OpenTemporal emphasises transparent communication, shared documentation, and measurable impact. Collaboration requests that align with these principles are prioritised.
